- Dumbell Deadlifts - 4 x 5 thinking 45lbs each -- went 60lbs each was hard but good
- Incline Dumbell Press - 3 x 10 thinking 45lbs each -- went 60lbs also. was hard 
- Dumbell Snatch - 3 x 8 thinking 40lbs each  -- did 40. easier on right arm. 
- Decline weighted situps 3 x 15 -- halfways with 10lbs. feel tightness in lower back. fear of going down all the when i do in past there is a seeminlgly benign click that freaks me out. 

- Notes: overall this may be the best, heaviest independent workout ive ever done. started out strong and surprised myself with heavier weight. the make a face distortion because its that heavy wanhee advice made sense and clicked for me here.
